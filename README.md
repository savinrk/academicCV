A template for academic CVs. Slightly modified from [David Grant's resume.](https://www.davidgrant.ca/latex_resume_template)

The .tex file does not require installation of any new pacakages. Compiling it with Overleaf or TexStudio (etc.) should result in cvTemplate.pdf 

If you do not want the name centered, use DG's version.
